4:T62a,### Feature: Faction Quick Links
- **New Sidebar Widget**: Implemented a dedicated "Quick Links" widget for all factions (DOJ, LSPD, LSEMS, SAFD), separate from Official Resources.
- **Admin Management**: Created independent managers for Quick Links (`/admin/[faction]/quick-links`) with icon picking and color selection.
- **Migration**: Moved legacy navigation buttons (Join, Roster, SOPs, etc.) from horizontal bars into this new sidebar system for a cleaner UI.
- **Smart Behavior**: Links starting with `#` now trigger smooth scrolling to page sections instead of opening new tabs.

### Feature: Universal Resources
- **Generic Architecture**: Refactored the Resources system to be fully generic, allowing any faction to have multiple resource lists (e.g., "Official Resources", "Quick Links").
- **DOJ Migration**: Consolidated DOJ-specific resource handling into the universal system.
- **Admin Panel**: Added dedicated "Resources" managers for all factions.

### Visual & UX Improvements
- **Contrast Update**: Increased background opacity and border contrast for Cards, Modals, and Rosters to improve readability against the black background.
- **Admin Layout**: Fixed layout issues where the sidebar/content height was incorrect, removing unnecessary scrollbars.
- **Bar Association**:
  - Added Photo URL, Bar Number, and Firm fields to the Attorney Roster.
  - Enhanced the Admin Bar Manager with photo upload support and nicer edit forms.
- **Cleanup**: Removed deprecated "Quick Action" grids (MDT, Impound, Gang Intel) to declutter faction pages.5:T4dc,### New Features
- **User Complaints Dashboard**: New portal (`/my-complaints`) for citizens to track filed complaints.
- **Notification System**: Real-time badge in Navbar for unread updates on complaints.
- **Enhanced Profile**: Users can now add IC Phone, Discord, Bio, and upload a Profile Photo.
- **Roster 2.0**: Complete visual overhaul of Faction Rosters with large cards, hover effects, and detailed info.
- **Developer Attribution**: Dedicated System Updates page with developer attribution and "Damon" icon.

### Improvements
- **Complaint Submission**: Improved success flow with direct link to tracking dashboard.
- **Navbar**: Converted Notification Bell to interactive dropdown with "Mark all as read".
- **Dashboard**: Implemented pagination (5 per page) for Recent Activity feed and added a "System Updates" widget.
- **UX**: Removed redundant "My Complaints" text link in favor of the notification center.

### Bug Fixes
- **Navigation**: Resolved 404 errors during complaint status redirection by ensuring `basePath` compatibility.
- **Complaint Modal**: Resolved issue where modal would leave page blurred after submission.
- **Complaint Security**: Enforced stricter author verification to prevent spoofing.0:{"buildId":"IZaoBFdgzc4oobgUTWtlR","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-8 max-w-5xl mx-auto","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-between items-center gap-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-slate-900 via-slate-800 to-slate-900 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-slate-800 shadow-2xl relative overflow-hidden","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-1 bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 via-purple-500 to-indigo-500"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"relative z-10 flex items-center gap-6","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-20 h-20 rounded-full border-4 border-slate-700/50 shadow-xl overflow-hidden relative group","children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/images/damon_icon.png","alt":"Damon","className":"w-full h-full object-cover group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform duration-500"}]}],["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-black text-white tracking-tight mb-1","children":"System Updates"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-slate-400 font-medium flex items-center gap-2","children":["Maintained & Developed by ",["$","span",null,{"className":"text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-400 to-purple-400 font-bold","children":"Damon"}]]}]]}]]}],["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/admin","className":"px-6 py-3 bg-slate-800 hover:bg-slate-700 text-white font-bold rounded-xl transition-colors flex items-center gap-2 border border-slate-700 relative z-10","children":[["$","svg",null,{"stroke":"currentColor","fill":"currentColor","strokeWidth":"0","viewBox":"0 0 448 512","children":["$undefined",[["$","path","0",{"d":"M257.5 445.1l-22.2 22.2c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0L7 273c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L201.4 44.7c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l22.2 22.2c9.5 9.5 9.3 25-.4 34.3L136.6 216H424c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v32c0 13.3-10.7 24-24 24H136.6l120.5 114.8c9.8 9.3 10 24.8.4 34.3z","children":[]}]]],"style":{},"height":"1em","width":"1em","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}]," Back to Dashboard"]}]]}],["$","$L3",null,{"items":[{"id":"log-0","version":"v3.7.1","title":"\"Command Center\" Changelog Redesign","content":"### Visual Overhaul\r\n- **Interactive Timeline**: Completely redesigned the Admin Changelog (`/admin/changelog`) with a sleek, vertical timeline layout.\r\n- **Smart Badges**: The system now automatically detects keywords in update notes (e.g., \"**Feature**\", \"**Bug Fix**\", \"**Visual**\") and transforms them into glowing, color-coded badges.\r\n- **Condensed UI**: Version history is now collapsible and condensed by default, allowing for easier navigation through long update histories.\r\n- **Premium Aesthetics**: Implemented glassmorphism cards, neon accents, and smooth expansion animations for a high-end feel.","date":"2026-01-12","author":"System"},{"id":"log-1","version":"v3.7","title":"Resources & Quick Links System","content":"$4","date":"2026-01-12","author":"System"},{"id":"log-2","version":"v3.6.2","title":"Admin \"Command Center\" Redesign","content":"### Admin Panel Overhaul\r\n- **Dual-Mode Sidebar**: Implemented Full vs. Mini (icon-only) toggle to maximize workspace area.\r\n- **Collapsible Categories**: Grouped navigation into collapsible sections (Judiciary, Police, Medical, Fire) for better organization.\r\n- **Horizontal Context Hub**: Added a secondary top bar with real-time breadcrumbs and dynamic **Quick Actions** (e.g., \"New Post\" button appears automatically in Announcements).\r\n- **Profile Standardization**: Consistent usage of custom `photoURL` across Navbar, Admin Top Bar, and Sidebar Profile items.\r\n\r\n### Navbar & UX\r\n- **Profile Dropdown**: Implemented a premium hover menu for the user pill with stabilized hover state.\r\n- **Visual Polish**: Added micro-animations to sidebar icons and enhanced glassmorphism depth.","date":"2026-01-11","author":"System"},{"id":"log-3","version":"v3.6.1","title":"Background Hotfix","content":"### Bug Fixes\r\n- **Layout Consistency**: Resolved an issue where **EMS** and **FD** pages had redundant layout files causing background \"cutoff\" bars and restricted widths on large monitors.\r\n- **Global Theme Sync**: Synchronized Navbar, Home Page, and Quick Navigation to use the pure black theme.","date":"2026-01-11","author":"System"},{"id":"log-4","version":"v3.6","title":"Dark Mode Redesign","content":"### Visual Overhaul & Dark Theme\r\n- **Global Dark Mode**: Switched to a pure black (`#000000`) theme for a premium, cinematic aesthetic.\r\n- **Admin Panel Redesign**:\r\n  -
